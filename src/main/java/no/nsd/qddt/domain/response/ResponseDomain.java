/**
 *
 * CodeList A special form of maintainable that allows a single codelist to be maintained outside of a CodeListScheme.
 *
 * GridResponseDomain;      Designates the response domain and the cells using the specified response domain within a QuestionGrid.
 * QuestionGrid;            Structures the QuestionGrid as an NCube-like structure providing dimension information, labeling options, and response domains attached to one or more cells within the grid.
 * QuestionItem;            Structure a single Question which may contain one or more response domains (i.e., a list of valid category responses where if "Other" is indicated a text response can be used to specify the intent of "Other").
 * ResponseDomainInMixed;   A structure that provides both the response domain and information on how it should be attached, or related, to other specified response domains in the question.
 * ->   CategoryDomain;     A response domain capturing a category (without an attached code) response for a question item.
 *      CodeDomain;         A response domain capturing a coded response (where both codes and their related category value are displayed) for a question item.
 *      DateTimeDomain;     A response domain capturing a date or time response for a question item.
 *      DistributionDomain; A response domain capturing a distribution response for a question, may only be included in-line.
 *      GeographicDomain;   A response domain capturing a geographic coordinate reading as a response for a question item.
 *      GeographicLocationCodeDomain; A response domain capturing the name or code of a Geographic Location as a response for a question item, may only be included in-line.
 *      GeographicStructureCodeDomain;A response domain capturing a geographic structure code as a response for a question item, may only be included in-line.
 *      LocationDomain;     A response domain capturing a location response (mark on an image, recording, or object) for a question, may only be included in-line.
 *      NominalDomain;      A response domain capturing a nominal (check off) response for a question grid response, may only be included in-line.
 *      NumericDomain;      A response domain capturing a numeric response (the intent is to analyze the response as a number) for a question item.
 *      RankingDomain;      A response domain capturing a ranking response which supports a "ranking" of categories. Generally used within a QuestionGrid, may only be included in-line.
 *      ScaleDomain;        A response domain capturing a scale response which describes a 1..n dimensional scale of various display types for a question.
 *      TextDomain;         A response domain capturing a textual response.
